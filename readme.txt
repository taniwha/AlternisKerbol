Alternis Kerbol plugin v0.1 by NovaSilisko

Alternis, God of Change and Difference decided to smite the hell out of the Kerbals' home solar system, and this is what happened.

Alternis Kerbol is a mod that grabs and re-arranges the existing solar system bodies to create something new. Most bodies have been changed in some way, large or small. Also, comets.

Changelog:
